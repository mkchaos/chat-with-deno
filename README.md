This is a practice for learning deno.

Inspired by [this_repo](github.com/aralroca/chat-with-deno-and-preact), but this is not work in current deno.

## Getting started

```
> git clone git@github.com:aralroca/chat-with-deno-and-preact.git
> cd chat-with-deno-and-preact
> deno run --allow-net --allow-read server.ts
